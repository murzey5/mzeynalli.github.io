I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Louisiana State University. 

My research interest is in the field of Labor Economics, with a particular focus on Economics of Immigration. In my job market paper, I study how immigration-induced local labor supply shocks affect workers and establishments across skill distribution in US counties. I am also interested in Economics of Religiosity and Health Economics in the contexts of local labor markets and mental health, respectively.

You can access the PDF version of my CV [here](/files/Murad_Zeynalli_CV.pdf).
